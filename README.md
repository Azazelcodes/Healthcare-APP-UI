# Healthcare-APP-UI
![](https://github.com/Azazelcodes/Healthcare-APP-UI/blob/main/BannerV.3.png)
Frontend of the app we've presented in Anime Tatake category of Expression 2021, can also be taken as an Idea, UI designed by @Azazelcodes

I've coded only the frame of the components(not including the assets) and the layers, why?
Cause I'm really lazy, lol

I'll upload the detailed (including layers,components and assets) from The Second-Homepage's code
and I'll upload a seperate Xml file of all those components (including text and assets too) that are used in almost every frame, like the home indicator or the iphone time thingy (cries in android)

Adding the second mockup: This is a special one cause I tried to copy the cred synth that I like very much while tweaking a few things to fit the payment gateway for the app as the app is not only a fitness/health app it also an app where you can buy things

I'll write the main idea as soon as I upload this project on behance and have my website up ,which might take a lot of time as I have studies and other projects so the deadline I've set for me is 1 september after 2nd sep I'll edit the readme for the main idea and post the flow and detailed explaination of the app.

I'll try to upload the code file in xml before 1st but no garuntee.
I'll also make repository for the code of my website as soon as it's hosted!

Lol it's 5th of sep and I still haven't finished this project, well in my defense I had work and school has started mid terms so can't do really much about it

I've redeisgned 2 of the pages currently cause I felt that the previous OG design was a bit idiotic and felt as the user would vomit after seeing it so..
I'll upload the redesigned frame's code and png image with prefix- Redeg
