# Healthcare-APP-UI
Frontend of the app we've presented in Anime Tatake category of Expression 2021, can also be taken as an Idea, UI designed by @Azazelcodes

I've coded only the frame of the components(not including the assets) and the layers, why?
Cause I'm really lazy, lol

I'll upload the detailed (including layers,components and assets) from The Second-Homepage's code
and I'll upload a seperate Xml file of all those components (including text and assets too) that are used in almost every frame, like the home indicator or the iphone time thingy (cries in android)
