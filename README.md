# Healthcare-APP-UI

Frontend of the app we've presented in Anime Tatake category of Expression 2021, can also be taken as an Idea, UI designed by @Azazelcodes

I've coded only the frame of the components(not including the assets) and the layers, why?
Cause I'm really lazy, lol

I'll upload the detailed (including layers,components and assets) from The Second-Homepage's code
and I'll upload a seperate Xml file of all those components (including text and assets too) that are used in almost every frame, like the home indicator or the iphone time thingy (cries in android)

Adding the second mockup: This is a special one cause I tried to copy the cred synth that I like very much while tweaking a few things to fit the payment gateway for the app as the app is not only a fitness/health app it also an app where you can buy things

I'll write the main idea as soon as I upload this project on behance and have my website up
